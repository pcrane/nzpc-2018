Robert King (E.py 10pt, L.py 30pt, O.py 100pt)
Ralph Verstegeen (K.py 30pt, P.py 100pt)
Antony Phillips (G.py 10pt, M.py 100pt, N.py 100pt)

If we hadn't have spent time on the 10 and 30 point problems, we likely would have solved all of the 100 point problems.
The idea was to make use of the computer early doing a few easy problems until someone is ready to do a harder problem,
however, a better strategy would have been to have everyone focus first on the high point problems, see which of them require known algorithms,
and then have someone start typing in code for the known algorithm while others on the team prepare code to type in.

N & P required slight optimisations to fit the time-limit, problem O had one edge case missing - skip/ignore squares that aren't reachable. Probably with just a few extra lines of code, N,P,O would have been solved for an extra 300 points.
The winning team had 220 points AFAIK.
